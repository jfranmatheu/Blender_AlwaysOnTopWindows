# Blender_AlwaysOnTopWindows

This addon allows you to have floating editors in Blender 2.80+ by just CTRL+SPACE at the active window to have it always on top (CTRL+SPACE again to disable it!)

JUST FOR WINDOWS USERS ! (srry)

# IN WHAT CONSIST?
Is just a little ahk script (1 line) that allows you to make windows to be always on top, then compacted with free AHK software to an executable that will be run via python that is just a line of code.
